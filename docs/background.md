## Project Background
An estimated 42.3 million people across 45 countries will be in Emergency or worse levels of acute food insecurity in 2024. Without urgent life-saving action, these populations will be at risk of falling into catastrophe or famine conditions. Globally, an estimated 45 million children under 5 were suffering from wasting. In 2024, the convergence of threats may further increase the number of children and pregnant and breastfeeding women affected by acute malnutrition. Women and girls are bearing the brunt of the food crisis due to the social norms and structural barriers that limit their influence over the use of vital resources.

The East Africa region struggles with recurrent climate shocks including drought and floods, pests, diseases, and food insecurity. Children, pregnant, and nursing women experiencing acute malnutrition are particularly vulnerable. The agriculture and livestock sector is dominated by rain-fed agriculture and the changing climate disproportionately affects the poor and marginalized groups in East Africa who have a lower capacity to adapt. Population growth and migration are further straining food security in the region.

Food price inflation also generally hits lower-income countries (and lower-income households everywhere) particularly hard, which makes it tantamount to a regressive tax. Food accounts for a much larger share of the average household consumption basket in EMDEs, which means that inflation in those economies is likely to prove persistent. Today’s higher energy prices will translate directly into higher food prices tomorrow (through higher costs for fertilizer, transport, and so forth).

Whether disaster, conflict, or pandemic, we know that after crisis strikes one of the most effective ways to help people get back on their feet is by giving them cash. When markets are functioning, cash — in the form of vouchers, prepaid debit cards, mobile transfers, bank account transfers, paper money, or cash-for-work — gives families the ability to purchase what they need the most.
